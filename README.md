# This project demonstrates the use of FastAPI for serving an image captioning model and a React frontend for uploading images and receiving captions.


This project consists of two main components:

1. **FastAPI Backend**: This serves as the backend server responsible for receiving image uploads, generating captions using a pre-trained image captioning model, and sending the captions back to the client.

2. **React Frontend**: This provides a user-friendly interface for uploading images and viewing the generated captions. Users can interact with the frontend to upload images, which are then sent to the FastAPI backend for caption generation.

3. **vgg16** : we have implemented vgg16 to extract the features from the images
